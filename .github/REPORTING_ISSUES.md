# FishTank-Vue Issue Reporting Guidelines
Hello and thank you for interest in helping make FishTank-Vue better. Please take a few moments to review the following guidelines.


## Reporting Issues
* The issue list of this repo is <strong>exclusively</strong> for bug reports and feature requests. Non-conforming issues will be closed immediately.
* Try to search for your issue, it may have been answered.
* See if the error can be reproduced with the latest version.
* If it can be reproduced, please provide a [simple codepen](https://codepen.io) or repository that can be cloned to produce the expected behavior. It is preferred that you create an initial commit with no changes first, then another one that will cause the issue. 
* **Never** comment "+1" or "me too!" on issues without leaving additional information, use the :+1: button in the top right instead.
